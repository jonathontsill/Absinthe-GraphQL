# Jon's GraphQL Server

This repository serves as a proof-of-concept of creating a GraphQL server using Absinthe(https://github.com/absinthe-graphql) to handle GraphQL queries submitted via Phoenix(https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) in Elixir. Testing was done using GraphiQL(https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).
